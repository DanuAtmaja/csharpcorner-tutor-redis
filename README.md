# Redis Cache Implementation in .NET Core API

This repository demonstrates the implementation of Redis cache in a .NET Core API based on the article "Implementation of the Redis Cache in the .NET Core API" from C# Corner. The original article can be found [here](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/implementation-of-the-redis-cache-in-the-net-core-api/).

## Overview

The provided code showcases how to integrate Redis cache into a .NET Core API for efficient caching of data and improving performance. The implementation covers the following aspects:

- Setting up Redis cache in a .NET Core API project.
- Configuring Redis as the cache provider.
- Implementing caching in the API controllers.
- Demonstrating how to use Redis cache for both read and write operations.
- Handling cache invalidation and updating the cache when data changes.

## Getting Started
